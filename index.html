    <h1>The fourd.js Library</h1>
    <p>The fourd.js library allows web developers to dynamically visualize graphs in 3D.</p>
    <p>Seven years in the making, this project is inspired by Todd Veldhuizen's <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1549">Dynamic Multilevel Graph Visualization</a> and <a href="http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/">Ubigraph</a>. This library is written in javascript using <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/">mrdoob</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js">three.js. Thank You!</a></p>

    <h2>What do these words mean?</h2>
    <span class="definition">A <b>Graph</b> is a collection of vertices and edges. Think of a train network or phone and power lines. In the train network, the train stations are the vertices (singular: vertex, also called nodes), while the tracks the train travels on are the edges. The phone and power lines are the edges, the poles and buildings are vertices.<br /></span>
    <span class="definition"><b>Dynamic</b> in this context means the vertices and edges don't have to be known upfront. You can add or remove them on the go. <br /></span>
    <span class="definition"><b>3D or FourD.</b> We agree to call a flat surface representing depth "3D" as long as its elements move. Time is considered a fourth dimension, supported by the ability to add and remove vertices and edges dynamically.<br /></span>
    <h2>What's it good for?</h2>
    <span class="definition"><b>It's a library</b> it can be used to visualize graphs.<br /></span>
    <span class="definition"><b>Shapes</b> One could use it for a collection of mathematical shapes.<br /></span>
    <span class="definition"><b>Visualize Society</b> I originally intended to make a map of society, letting learners share maps of their social environments with each other. This is the kind of data that gets people in trouble - use good judgement, I am abandoning this project. It could be good for classrooms or social work.<br /></span>
    <span class="definition"><b>Showing History</b> With this project, I intend to make an exploratory infographic of the history of management structures that lead to the torture of CIA detainees. That's a mouthful. Having worked general labor before college, I had no idea what management looks like. If I pull this off, anyone with restaurant experience will understand what happened at Guantanamo and other detention sites. This is a sensitive topic, which makes it important this subject is presented in an objective and accessible manner. To that end, I want to cite credible sources, in my case, the Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Torture. If you navigate the art or education worlds, please contact me (I'm a Software Engineer). If you happen to have special knowledge, presenting me with a letter from an elected official would help me determine your authenticity. There's a lot of undercover spy stories out there. <br /></span>
    <span class="definition"><b>Other Uses</b> You know how social media presents the user with contact lists -- Why can't we have nice things? Whoever came up with circles for social networks was ahead of the curve!<br /></span>
    
    <h2>I like your project, how can I help</h2>
    <span class="definition"><b>I don't know, send me an email!</b> We'll figure something out, everyone can do something, bring an idea to the table.<br /></span>
    <span class="definition"><b>My parentals won't let me.</b> Old wisdom goes not to discuss politics at the dinner table, if you've survived this long, you already know how to behave. That said, talk to your friends, make new friends, and bug your teachers. (Teachers love PTA meetings)<br /></span>
    
    <h2>Technical Stuff: How does it work?</h2>
    <h3>Changelog, or: what works and what doesn't</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>vertices are shown</li>
      <li>edges are shown</li>
      <li>vertices can show colors or pictures (called <i>textures</i> in code)</li>
      <li>labels don't work yet</li>
    </ul>
    
    <span>
      <h3>API</h3>
      <span>The API defined by fourd.js is quite simple.
      <pre>
var fourd = new FourD(); // instantiation
fourd.init('#selector', {width: 600, height: 350}); // initialization
 
 
var vertex_options = {
  cube: {
    width: 5, // pixels
    height: 5,
    depth: 5,
    color: 0x000000 // hex color
  }
};
 
// or:

var vertex_options = {
  cube: {
    width: 5,
    height: 5,
    depth: 5,
    texture: 'path_to,png'
  }
}
 
// or:
 
// leave out vertex options altogether.
// default values will be used.
 
 
var vertex1 = fourd.graph.add_vertex(vertex_options); // add a vertex
var vertex2 = fourd.graph.add_vertex(vertex_options); // add another vertex
 
var edge_options = {}; // currently not defined, but this is how you would pass them.
 
var edge = fourd.graph.add_edge(vertex1, vertex2, edge_options);
 
fourd.graph.remove_edge(edge); // this is why you keep those variables
fourd.graph.remove_vertex(vertex1);
fourd.graph.remove_vertex(vertex2);
      </pre>
      </span>
    </span>
    </span>
    
    <h2>Compatibility</h2>
    <span>Intended to run in the browser, it has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11. Rumor has it that by switching to the CanvasRenderer, the library even works on a Raspberry PI. This is, of course, complete and utter nonsense, and when I catch those responsible ...</span><br /><br />
    
    <h2>Other questions</h2>
    <span><b>Can I have it?</b> Absolutely. The library is available on <a href="https://github.com/lowrekey/fourd.js">github.com</a> Contributions are welcome.</span><br /><br />
    
    <span><b>What's today's date?</b> Gong... Today is Monday, April, the 27th, 2015</span><br /><br />
    
    <span><b>Credits</b>This library is a labor of love. It began in college and continued way past. It is not complete. But this milestone is a cause to celebrate. I want to thank the woman who got me into Computer Science in the first place (you know who you are), and my mother, who has supported me and endured endless rants on a topic completely foreign to her. Love you!</span><br /><br />
